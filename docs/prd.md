## Original Requirements
The boss has tasked us with creating a command line interface (CLI) blackjack game. 

## Product Goals
```python
[
    "Create a simple, easy-to-use CLI blackjack game",
    "Ensure the game follows the standard rules of blackjack",
    "Make the game engaging and replayable"
]
```

## User Stories
```python
[
    "As a user, I want to be able to start a new game easily so I can play whenever I want",
    "As a user, I want clear instructions on how to play the game so I can understand the rules",
    "As a user, I want the game to keep track of my score so I can see how I'm doing",
    "As a user, I want the game to be fair and follow standard blackjack rules so it feels authentic",
    "As a user, I want to be able to quit the game at any time so I can stop playing when I want"
]
```

## Competitive Analysis
```python
[
    "Python Blackjack Game: A simple CLI blackjack game. It's easy to use but lacks engaging features",
    "Java Blackjack Game: A more complex game with additional features, but it's not as user-friendly",
    "Ruby Blackjack Game: A well-balanced game with a good mix of simplicity and features",
    "JavaScript Blackjack Game: A game with a lot of features, but it's not as easy to use",
    "C# Blackjack Game: A game with a good user interface, but it doesn't follow standard blackjack rules"
]
```

## Requirement Analysis
The product should be a command line interface blackjack game. It should be simple and easy to use, follow the standard rules of blackjack, and be engaging and replayable. The game should also keep track of the user's score and allow them to quit at any time.

## Requirement Pool
```python
[
    ("Implement the basic rules of blackjack", "P0"),
    ("Create a command line interface for the game", "P0"),
    ("Implement a score tracking system", "P1"),
    ("Allow the user to quit the game at any time", "P1"),
    ("Add engaging features to make the game replayable", "P2")
]
```

## UI Design draft
The game will be a text-based command line interface. It will display the user's current hand and score, as well as the dealer's visible card. The user will be able to input commands to hit, stand, or quit the game. The game will have a simple, clean design with clear, easy-to-read text.

## Anything UNCLEAR
There are no unclear points.
