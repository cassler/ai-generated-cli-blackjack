## Logic Analysis
```python
[
    ("main.py", "Contains the main function to start the game."),
    ("game.py", "Contains the game logic, should be implemented after player, dealer, card, deck and scoreboard."),
    ("player.py", "Contains the Player class with hit and stand methods, should be implemented after card."),
    ("dealer.py", "Contains the Dealer class with deal method, should be implemented after card and deck."),
    ("card.py", "Contains the Card class, can be implemented first."),
    ("deck.py", "Contains the Deck class with shuffle and draw methods, should be implemented after card."),
    ("scoreboard.py", "Contains the Scoreboard class with update_score and display_score methods, should be implemented after player.")
]
```

## Task list
```python
[
    "card.py",
    "player.py",
    "deck.py",
    "dealer.py",
    "scoreboard.py",
    "game.py",
    "main.py"

## Shared Knowledge
```python
"""
'card.py' contains the Card class with suit, rank and value attributes. 
'deck.py' uses the Card class to create a deck of cards and has methods to shuffle and draw cards.
'player.py' and 'dealer.py' use the Card class to hold their current cards.
'scoreboard.py' uses the Player class to update and display the player's score.
'game.py' uses all the other classes to control the game flow.
'main.py' is the entry point of the program and starts the game.
